# Amiga Source


This is source from around 1991. I used to use it a lot more but have totally lost touch with using it. When I look at it now it's hard to believe I used to code in it. I will need to start at ground zero again, right from hello world to get used to it again. 

I would love to make something for the amiga. I'm looking at doing a game in assembler or C and have also looked in to Blitz and Amos.

Let's hope something comes from this.
